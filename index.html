        <p> During the Civil War era many factions sought to change America. Remarkable speakers spread
            their ideas through oratory, thrilling their audiences through powerful speeches that appealed
            to both emotion and logic. <br> Douglass, a black American, fought for black civil rights
            through compelling speeches like “What to the slave is the Fourth of July?” which depicted the
            terrors of slavery in graphic detail.<br> Abraham Lincoln, on the other hand, spoke peacefully and
            optimistically during his Second Inaugural Address to demonstrate his desire for peace and
            reconciliation with the Confederate states.<br> Both speakers captivated their audiences through
            persuasive diction, tone, and argumentative methods in an effort to win them over and gain
            their support.<br>During the Civil War era many factions sought to change America. Remarkable speakers spread
